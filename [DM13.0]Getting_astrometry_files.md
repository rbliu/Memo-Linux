# Get astrometry reference files

* Download the SDSS-dr9 astrometry data. They should have names like `sdss-dr9-fink-v5b_and_282_0.fits`.

* Setup DMstack as usual. 

* Before running `processCcd.py`, create a directory named `astrometry_net_data`:
```
mkdir astrometry_net_data
```

* Obtain the WCS coordinates of the cluster you are going to process. (Here we take A85 as an example, which has RA=10.459, DEC=-9.302 deg)

* Run the command:
```
get-healpix -N8 10.459 -- -9.302
```
and the output should be
```
(RA, DEC) = (10.459, -9.302) degrees
Healpix=282 in the XY scheme (bighp=4, x=3, y=2)
  healpix=432 in the RING scheme (ringnum=18, longind=0)
  healpix=269 in the NESTED scheme.
Healpix center is (5.625, -9.5940682) degrees
Healpix is bounded by RA=[0, 11.25], Dec=[-14.4775, -4.78019] degrees.
Healpix scale is 26384.5 arcsec.
```
where `Healpix=282 in the XY scheme (bighp=4, x=3, y=2)` gives the healpix number `282`.

* We copy the corresponding astrometry reference files to the `astrometry_net_data` directory you just created `astrometry_net_data`:
```
cp /path/to/sdss/astrometry/data/sdss-dr9-fink-v5b_and_282_*.fits /working/directory/astrometry_net_data/
```

* At last, add an `andConfig.py` to the directory with the following lines:
```
filters = "ugriz"
root.magColumnMap = dict([(f,f) for f in filters])
root.magErrorColumnMap = dict([(f, f + '_err') for f in filters])
root.indexFiles = ["sdss-dr9-fink-v5b_and_282_0.fits",
               "sdss-dr9-fink-v5b_and_282_1.fits",
               "sdss-dr9-fink-v5b_and_282_2.fits"]
```

* Therefore, the directory should have the structure:
```
astrometry_net_data/
|-- andConfig.py
|-- sdss-dr9-fink-v5b_and_282_0.fits
|-- sdss-dr9-fink-v5b_and_282_1.fits
`-- sdss-dr9-fink-v5b_and_282_2.fits
```
