*From Simon Krughoff's notes*

How to run `obs_file`

# 1. Get data

Here I use **filename=trial07.fits** as an example.

# 2. Get obs_file 

(assuming you have a stack set up)

```
git clone https://github.com/SimonKrughoff/obs_file
cd obs_file
git checkout tickets/DM-6924
setup -k -r .
scons
cd ..
```

# 3. Setup repo 

(for example, we call the working repo as 'repo', you will need to run all the DMstack commands under this repo directory)

```
mkdir repo
cd repo
cp PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGES . (cp /PATH/TO/trial07.fits . in this case)
```
make a directory to put things in – 
```
mkdir input
```
provide a mapper – 
```
echo "lsst.obs.file.FileMapper" > input/_mapper
```

# 4. Ingest the data
```
ingestImages.py input/ trial07.fits --mode link
```

# 5. Process the data
```
processCcd.py input/ --id filename=trial07.fits --config isr.noise=5 --output output
```
Note that you need to make a pretty goood guess at the noise in the image.  This is something I'd like to fix.
